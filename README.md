# MarkdownLivePreview

A simple plugin to preview your markdown as you type right in Sublime Text.
No dependencies!

## How to install

It's available on package control!

## How to contribute

If you know what feature you want to implement, or what bug you wanna fix, then
go ahead and hack! But if you wanna contribute just to say thanks, and don't
really know what you could be working on, then there are a bunch of `FIXME`s
in `MarkdownLivePreview.py` and `markdown2html.py` (GitHub only shows the top
2 results if you try to search using their interface :slightly_frowning_face:).

### Hack it!

1. Fork this repo
2. Make your own branch (the name of the branch should be the feature you are
   implementing eg. `improve-tables`, `fix-crash-on-multiple-preview`
3. All your code should be formated by black.
4. Send a PR!

FIXME: add a git hook to format using black (can the git hook be added on github?)
