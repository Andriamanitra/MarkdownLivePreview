So, let's\nget started\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\nUsing Package Control\n\n\nYou can really easily install MarkdownLivePreview by using \nPackage Control\n.\n\n\nIf it's not already, you need to \ninstall it\n first.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIf you're using the latest build of Sublime Text 3, you can just do\n\nTools \u2192 Install Package Control\u2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen up the command palette (\nctrl+shift+p\n)\n\n\nSearch up \nPackage Control: Install Package\n (might take a few seconds)\n\n\nIn the panel that just showed up, search for \nMarkdownLivePreview\n\n\n\n\nDone!

If you want to just use MarkdownLivePreview, pick the first\nsolution, you'll get every update automatically. But if you want to contribute, then choose the\nsecond solution.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nPreviewing\n\n\nAs told in the introduction, MarkdownLivePreview is very easy to use:\n\n\n\n\nopen a markdown file\n\n\npress \nalt+m\n\n\nor select in the command palette \nMarkdownLivePreview\n:\n \nEdit\n \nCurrent\n \nFile\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe preview of unsaved markdown files is currently not supported. It should be fixed soon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nMarkdown Extended\n is supported too!\n\n\n\n\nThat's it. That's all you need to do to preview your markdown!\n\n\nCustom CSS\n\n\nIf you want to, you can add custom \nCSS\n to the MarkdownLivePreview's default stylesheet.\n\n\nJust search for \nMarkdownLivePreview\n:\n \nEdit\n \nCustom\n \nCSS\n \nFile\n in the command palette\n(\nctrl+shift+p\n). It will open a file in which you can add some CSS that will be \nadded\n to\nthe normal CSS.\n\n\n\n\nBug\n\n\nComments in the CSS is interpreted weirdly by Sublime Text's phantoms. After a few tests, I\nthink that everything that is bellow a comment is ignored.\n\n\nIf you want to be sure that your CSS works, don't put any comments in it\n\n\n\n\nShare your tweaks!\n\n\nIf you think that other users would enjoy your added CSS, then raise an issue, or PR the\n\nGitHub repo\n to share your tweaks!\n\n\nClearing the cache\n\n\nMarkdownLivePreview has a cache system to store images you load from internet. You can clear this\ncache by searching up in the command palette \nMarkdownLivePreview\n:\n \nClear\n \nthe\n \ncache\n.\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe cache is one simple file called \nMarkdownLivePreviewCache\n, which is located in your temp\nfolder. To know where it is, you can open the Sublime Text console (\nctrl+`\n or\n\nView \u2192 Show Console\n), and paste this in:\n\n\nimport\n \ntempfile\n;\n \nprint\n(\ntempfile\n.\ngettempdir\n())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom settings for the preview\n\n\nSublime Text makes it easy to set custom settings for a specific \ntype\n of view. For example,\n\nmarkdown\n, \npython\n, etc. MarkdownLivePreview takes advantage of that: the preview view (the view\non the right) is a specific syntax (called \u2014 sorry for the originality \u2014\n\nMarkdownLivePreviewSyntax\n). So, to change this, you can focus the right view, open up the command\npalette (\nctrl+shift+p\n), and search up \nPreferences\n:\n \nSettings\n \n\u2014\n \nSyntax\n \nSpecific\n. In here,\nyou can specify any settings that is going to be applied only to this view.\n\n\nThe hacky part\n\n\nIn fact, MarkdownLivePreview parses those settings, and looks for specific ones:\n\n\n\n\nshow_tabs\n\n\nshow_minimap\n\n\nshow_status_bar\n\n\nshow_sidebar\n\n\nshow_menus\n\n\n\n\nThose settings aren't supported by default because they affect the entire \nwindow\n instead of just\nthe view. But MarkdownLivePreview will look for them in your \npreview\n's settings, and hide/show the\ntabs, the minimap, etc...\n\n\nAs you probably guessed those settings takes a bool for value (\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n).\n\n\nRecommendation\n\n\nHere's what I'd recommend (and use):\n\n\n{\n\n    \nshow_menus\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \nshow_tabs\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \nshow_minimap\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \ngutter\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \nrulers\n:\n \n[],\n\n    \nword_wrap\n:\n \ntrue\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nOn Windows at least, you can press \nalt\n to focus (so show) the menu, even if they're\noriginally hidden\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! I hope you'll enjoy using this package! If it's the case, please let your friends know\nabout it, and even myself by sending me a \ntweet\n or staring the repo\n\n!",
